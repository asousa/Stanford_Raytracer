!  This subroutine models the plasmapause location and slope using a
!  modified Lorentzian function as the basis.  It returns a factor
!  that is used elsewhere to effect inclusion of the plasmapause
!  transition from the inner plasmasphere to the trough.
!
!  The factor returned varies from a value of 1 well inside a8
!  to a value of 0 well outside a8.
!
!  The rotation of the bulge with variation with Kpmax has been included
!
!  A plasmapause profile is obtained from Carpenter & Anderson [1991] combined
!  with Higel & Wu [1984] and Moldwin et al, [1994].
!  The profile is included in a8.
!
!  An average Kpmax dependence for the plasmapause slope is also included in
!  a9.

    !  The plasmapause location and steepness are based on Carpenter and 
    !  Anderson, 1992.  The values of a8 and a9 are used to define these
    !  locations, respectively.  They are somewhat interdependent, however,
    !  so the consequence of there being a magnetic local time dependence
    !  for the plasmapause steepness is that both a8 and a9 must be
    !  expressed as functions of MLT.  Figure 9(a) measurements were used
    !  to obtain these fits.  Carpenter and Anderson's Section 3: Summary
    !  equation #3 was not used, because it systemmatically increases
    !  across 12 hours to 15 hours rather than peaking near 12 hours
    !  as discussed in the text and is evident in their Figure 9(a).
    !  As a result of fitting a sine wave function to Figure 9(a) of
    !  Carpenter and Anderson [1992] the following is obtained
    !       DELpp=0.0362*sin(mlt/12*pi-1.7015)
    !  This fitted function is now shifted slightly to earlier MLT 
    !  (by 0.4992 MLT) and used for finding fits for a8 and a9.
